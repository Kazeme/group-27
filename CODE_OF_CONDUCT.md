# Code of Conduct

1. All members are to contribute equally (unless exceptional circumstances apply)
2. If a member is late to a meeting they must buy a snack for the whole team
3. If a member is late to a meeting three times they must submit a fine of Â£10 to be split among the group and get tased
4. If a member is late for a checkup they must take everyone out for an expensive dinner (if it is expensive enough shall be determined by the group).
5. If a member is late twice for a checkup they shall be kicked out both figuratively and physically.
6. Members shall complete tasks assigned to them on time for sprint. If a task is not completed it will continue to the next week. If it is still not completed by the second week and they have not asked for reasonable help, they must buy a round of drinks. If they are still assigned the task and do not complete it in the third week then kicking out may be warranted.
7. Members will help others when and where they can, within reason.
